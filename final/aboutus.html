      <h3>Where it Began</h3>
      <p>In 1914, Joanna and Robert Jameson opened a small bed and breakfast called The Grand Coast. With a mission to showcase the beauty of California's forests and coast, they organized small hike and kayak tours. Joanna integrated her love for bird watching into the guided tours, which at the time was not common. Eventually, with their guided tours and dedication to hospitality they grew their quaint bed and breakfast into an iconic California oasis that connects people to nature with a variety of amenities. In 1951, the state of California recognized the property as a historic site and today the property is owned and maintained by Gretchen Jameson and her husband Brandon Carlstrom.</p>
