    <p>My favorite beverage is Masala Chai, which I have been experimenting with making from home. I used to always order dirty chai lattes at cafes, and figure why not just learn how to make authentic chai! I grind cinnamon, star anise, cardamom and clove using a mortar and pestle, then boil with black assam tea and milk and voila! </p>
